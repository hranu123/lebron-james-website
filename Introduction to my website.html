     In this website, I expressed all the information and knowledge about Lebron I developed as a Lebron fan from the perspective of the fictional character I made up"Lebron's Biggest Fan"
        Also, I decided implement a combination of the colors purple, yellow and red wine into my website because purple and yellow represent the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball team that Lebron currently plays on and red wine represents the teams Lebron previously played on: Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat. The backround of the navigation bar and font of the text within the page selected is yellow, the font color of the names of the navigation menus and background of the page are purple and the navigation menus appear as red wine whenever you hover over them.</p>
