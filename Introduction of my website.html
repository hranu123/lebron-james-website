    <h1><b><I><u>Introduction of what this website will be about?</u></I></b></h1><br>
    <p> In this website, I speak from the perspective of a fictional character,Lebron's biggest fan, one of the many people registered in the official vote for "Lebron's Biggest Fan Award" hosted by the official NBA channel. He has the uttermost commitment towards achieving his goal of being elected as "Lebron's Biggest Fan" not only because there is are rewards involved, including a front row ticket to a Lakers game and a meet-in-greet with Lebron, that the winner of the vote will receive, but also to have the title as "Lebron's Biggest Fan." He will achieve his goal by expressing the knowledge he has to the viewer of the website as it will allow for him to indicate to the viewer that he has a large amount of knowledge about Lebron and is an immense supporter of Lebron. Since the viewers are now aware of the amount of knowledge he possess, which is evidence of his supportiveness of Lebron and a representation of how big of a fan he is of Lebron, the viewer might consider voting for him as "Lebron's Biggest Fan" increasing his chances of him successfully achieving his goal of being voted as "Lebron's Biggest Fan."


     In this website, I expressed all the information and knowledge about Lebron I developed as a Lebron fan from the perspective of the fictional character I made up "Lebron's Biggest Fan," who also has the name: "Harik Ranu."
        Also, I decided implement a combination of the colors purple, yellow, gold and red wine into my website because purple and yellow represent the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball team that Lebron currently plays on, gold represents his famous nickname: "King Lebron James" and red wine represents the teams Lebron previously played on: Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat.<br>
         The background of the navigation bar and font of the text within the page you're are on is yellow, the font color of the names of the navigation menus and background of the page are purple, the divider in between the paragraphs are a combination of red wine and gold, and the bottom border on navigation menus appear as red wine, the left border appears as purple and the right border appears as gold whenever you hover over them.</p>
